P+X:

One must have a mind of his
To regard the frost and the great
Of the pine-trees crusted with the
And have been cold a long while
To behold the junipers shagged with their
The spruces rough in the distant south,
Of the January sun; and not to be
Of any misery in the sound of the voices,
In the sound of a few small
Which is the sound of the fire
Full of the same And
That is blowing in the same bare wind.
For the listener, who listens in the current
And, nothing himself, everything
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that exists
